# gAttendance - The Galvanize Attendance Tracker

[gAttendance](https://gAttendance.surge.sh) is an attendance tracking app designed with Galvanize instructors in mind. The app was built to accurately track student attendance using RFID cards while saving time that would be lost to a manual tracking system. Additionally, instructors have access to a dashboard with persistent, real-time data and several filtering options.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The frontend framework used
* [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - The CSS framework used
* [Go Lang](https://golang.org/) - The backend language used
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The DMBS used
* [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - The internet connected device used with an RFID reader and linux
